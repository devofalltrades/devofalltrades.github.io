<h3>NSTP[1]: Self and Others</h3>
<h3><i>Michelle Yzabel Alcantara</i></h3>
<b>If I were to summarize, it would go like so:</b>
<ol>
<li>Introduction and Insight</li>
<li>We must first know ourselves before we can serve</li>
<li>Understanding others is needed in giving service</li>
<li>We are all different</li>
<li>Closing</li>
</ol>

<h3>Introduction and Insight</h3>
<p>
The topic was very interesting because it lead us to introspection. The power walk was really fun too I was actually looking forward to doing it because I've been sitting around for a long time that I'm starting to disentegrate (hehe). Not only that, I love the energy of NIP. I love how our professors are so extra and bibo, it makes nstp common module way more bearable for a guy with medium attention span. The things that I have learned and appreciated during the NSTP[1]: Self and Others are down below.
</p>

<h3>We must first know ourselves before we can serve</h3>
<p>
The speaker began with a term: kapwa. For us Filipinos, the term itself is very intuitive because it has always been with us ever since we gained our own consciousness. When the speaker asked what kapwa is, I immediately thought to myself: that's easy, it's just another person or someone else.
</p>

<p>
However, placed in the context of service, kapwa doesn't just mean another person because the word itself is tied to its partner: pakikipagkapwa. The word "pakikipagkapwa" is binded to the word kapwa itself. But if you think of it, using "another person" as the definition of kapwa doesn't make sense with pakikipagkapwa. Why? Well that's because in order to be able to engage in "pakikipagkapwa" I must know the other person to a certain extent. This will allow me to gauge the middle ground between our differences. This will also help me in grasping the situation of the other person. As you can see kapwa can't just be "another person" because we have to communicate and genuinely know/relate the other person in order to be able to engage in pakikipagkapwa. This concept of pakikipagkapwa is deeply rooted in giving service because I cannot genuinely give service without knowing who the people I'm serving are.

## NSTP[0]: Orientation Day
>If I were to summarize, it would go like so:
>- It was brief
>- It was fun
>- It was a challenge

### It was brief

>Despite the NSTP sessions taking three hours every monday, our first day was really brief. We didn't take up the entire session mainly because it was only meant for orientation. However, they gave ample time to explain everything and to make everything clear. I would love it if we were given time to meet our respective professors and talk to them. It would have given us an opportunity to get their name and their social networking sites where we'lll be going to submit our reflections.

### It was fun

>It was fun, because they gave us the opportunity to be creative and to be ourselves with the reflection system. I already thought of a lot of ways to deliver my reflection for day one onwards, but I first decided to go with my developer's blog for the orientation day reflection. However, if given enough time I'm planning on creating an interactive game where my professors would have to solve a puzzle or complete a mini game in order to be able to read my reflection. Not only does this spice things up, but it also makes my reflection unique.

### It was a challenge

>Lastly, the videos they showed were really great, but after listening for some time it was clear that they were encouraging us and challenging us to make nationalistic choices for our future careers. Other than that, the biggest challenge of all is the fact that NSTP is a 8AM class.

### Closing

>With all that said, I have high hopes for NSTP. I hope I get to enjoy it by meeting new friends, speakers, and learning new things. I believe NSTP will allow me to interact with people who have other paradigms of thought. I look foward to everything.
