<h3>Thinking Before Helping</h3>
<p>
The most memorable part of the talk was when the speaker told a story on why you shouldn't donate milk in case of disaster. He said that while the milk may be sterile, the water that the people will be using in liquifying the milk is actually contaminated due to the disaster's after effects. In this regard, this really struck me because I've always though of donating milk until the speaker mentioned this. And with that, I believe it is vital to think before we help and to make sure that we are really informed on how we can really help the people in need in times of disaster.

<h3>What I truly learned from this talk</h3>
<p>
The ultimate lesson in this speech is the existence of our differences. We all have fine tuned differences that may not conform to what people believe in, but are still valid and existing differences. If I were to eloquently describe it with visualization it would be that we are all blank porcelain pots in the beginning, but as we progress through life we make sense of the world differently. It doesn't mean that just because we are porcelains, means that we only want to be the basic porcelain. We can experience changes along the way such as cracks, color, shine, and other factors that make our identity as a porclein unique. Hence, there is no such thing as the same person. I believe we are all different within.

<h3>Introduction and Insight</h3>
Imagine having to listen to different laws and human rights last week only to be surprised with the same speaker wearing different clothes and representing a marginalized group of society. Let me tell you, it was quite a shocker. I was shocked, but it wasn't bad. I believe that if there's something that surprise taught me, it's the limitless truth of a human being. You don't have to be limited by society or by social constructs. Who you want to be will become a reality with enough effort, regardless of social constructs.

<ol>
<li>Introduction and Insight</li>
<li>Special Rights?</li>
<li>Closing</li>
</ol>

<h3>Introduction and Insight</h3>
<p>
Let me kick this off by saying that the presentation/talk that was delivered by the speaker is helpful in informing us about our rights. However the delivery and the way the topics were presented were very dull and plain which made it harder for me to learn and to listen. That aside, among all of the topics she discussed, I was particularly interested with the frequently asked questions (FAQs).
</p>

<h3>Special Rights?</h3>
<p>
As I have mentioned in my introduction and insights, I was rather hooked on the frequently asked questions segment because the questions were very timely with our current generation. But amongst all the questions, the one that truly left an impression goes like this: are there special rights? There are a lot of situations where this questions could be raised but one of the most recent ones is the: Black Lives Matter campaign. The Black Lives Matter movement aim to remind people that there's nothing wrong with being African-American. It is also a reminder that, regardless of their skin they matter just as much as every single human being here on Earth. However, due to this movement a propaganda that aims to subvert the Black Lives Matter movement has started. Countless people start to argue that, every single person's life matters so why are they giving special rights to Black Lives? Well, it was answered during the speaker's discussion. It is clear that there is no such thing as special rights. Rather, the marginalized groups are given aid and protection in order to give them the opportunity to exercise their rights. Because as marginalized groups, they are deprived of some of their fundamental rights such as living a safe life.

<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>
All in all, the reflection today is pretty short because I was really having a hard time retaining the information during the talk because the way it was delivered was very dull and plain.

<h2>NSTP[1]: Self and Others</h2>
<h3><i>Michelle Yzabel Alcantara</i></h3>
![NSTP DAY 1](/img/day1.jpg)
<b>If I were to summarize, it would go like so:</b>
<ol>
<li>Introduction and Insight</li>
<li>We must first know ourselves before we can serve</li>
<li>Understanding others is needed in giving service</li>
<li>We are all different</li>
<li>Closing</li>
</ol>

<h3>Introduction and Insight</h3>
<p>
The topic was very interesting because it lead us to introspection. The power walk was really fun too I was actually looking forward to doing it because I've been sitting around for a long time that I'm starting to disentegrate (hehe). Not only that, I love the energy of NIP. I love how our professors are so extra and bibo, it makes nstp common module way more bearable for a guy with medium attention span. The things that I have learned and appreciated during the NSTP[1]: Self and Others are down below.
</p>

<h3>We must first know ourselves before we can serve</h3>
<p>
I imagined myself in a context of giving service. With this, I was able to determine that I would definitely be placed in situations that I abhor or situations that I will definitely be uncomfortable in. But with the speaker, I was able to learn that I can turn uncomfortable situations into something more bearable by understanding myself more and finding the boundaries of my comforts and discomforts. This way, I will be able to manage situations better, because I would be prepared on how to react during certain situations. It is true that communication is needed in order to give service. I have learned that if I don't know my own situation, I won't be able to give service.
</p>

<h3>Understanding others is needed in giving service</h3>
<p>
The speaker began with a term: kapwa. For us Filipinos, the term itself is very intuitive because it has always been with us ever since we gained our own consciousness. When the speaker asked what kapwa is, I immediately thought to myself: that's easy, it's just another person or someone else. However, placed in the context of service, kapwa doesn't just mean another person because the word itself is tied to its partner: pakikipagkapwa. The word "pakikipagkapwa" is binded to the word kapwa itself. But if you think of it, using "another person" as the definition of kapwa doesn't make sense with pakikipagkapwa.
</p>

<p>Why? Well that's because in order to be able to engage in "pakikipagkapwa" I must know the other person to a certain extent. This will allow me to gauge the middle ground between our differences. This will also help me in grasping the situation of the other person. As you can see kapwa can't just be "another person" because we have to communicate and genuinely know/relate the other person in order to be able to engage in pakikipagkapwa. I have learned that this concept of pakikipagkapwa is deeply rooted in giving service because it will allow me to understand the people I'm serving, hence constantly reminding me of the purpose of why I am serving.
</p>

<h3>We are all different</h3>
<p>
On the latter part of the speech, the speaker showed a picture of a couple in which people are usually quick to judge: a Filipino(?) and a foreigner. The speaker said, that a lot of people think that a couple such as them is only binded with their needs where one needs financial support and the other needs intimacy. However, the speaker also said that on one said that the couple can't be genuinely in love. This reminded me that we are all indeed different people. There is one size fits all in the understanding and serving people. I learned that serving isn't about trying to one, rather it is about doing your best to find the common ground despite the differences in order to be able to serve.
</p>

<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>
All in all I was able to learn a lot from this session. I learned more about myself and my discomforts. I also learned more about kapwa and pakikipagkapwa. I used to think that service is just about doing what you have to do and that's it. But after this session, I have realized that serving has a purpose. Serving has a goal. Serving doesn't mean to grind and to go home. Serving means understanding who I'm serving and keeping that in mind in order to genuinely serve the people with my capabilities.
</p>

<p><b>I am aiming to become a software developer, security engineer, full-stack web developer, and Chief Executive Officer of my own company in the future. With this session I am reminded that there is a purpose to what I'll be doing in the future no matter how big or small.</b></p>

## NSTP[0]: Orientation Day
>If I were to summarize, it would go like so:
>- It was brief
>- It was fun
>- It was a challenge

### It was brief

>Despite the NSTP sessions taking three hours every monday, our first day was really brief. We didn't take up the entire session mainly because it was only meant for orientation. However, they gave ample time to explain everything and to make everything clear. I would love it if we were given time to meet our respective professors and talk to them. It would have given us an opportunity to get their name and their social networking sites where we'lll be going to submit our reflections.

### It was fun

>It was fun, because they gave us the opportunity to be creative and to be ourselves with the reflection system. I already thought of a lot of ways to deliver my reflection for day one onwards, but I first decided to go with my developer's blog for the orientation day reflection. However, if given enough time I'm planning on creating an interactive game where my professors would have to solve a puzzle or complete a mini game in order to be able to read my reflection. Not only does this spice things up, but it also makes my reflection unique.

### It was a challenge

>Lastly, the videos they showed were really great, but after listening for some time it was clear that they were encouraging us and challenging us to make nationalistic choices for our future careers. Other than that, the biggest challenge of all is the fact that NSTP is a 8AM class.

### Closing

>With all that said, I have high hopes for NSTP. I hope I get to enjoy it by meeting new friends, speakers, and learning new things. I believe NSTP will allow me to interact with people who have other paradigms of thought. I look foward to everything.
