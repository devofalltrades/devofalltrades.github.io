## NSTP[0]: Orientation Day
>If I were to summarize, it would go like so:
>- It was brief
>- It was fun
>- It was a challenge

### It was brief

>Despite the NSTP sessions taking three hours every monday, our first day was really brief. We didn't take up the entire session mainly because it was only meant for orientation. However, they gave ample time to explain everything and to make everything clear. I would love it if we were given time to meet our respective professors and talk to them. It would have given us an opportunity to get their name and their social networking sites where we'lll be going to submit our reflections.

### It was fun

>It was fun, because they gave us the opportunity to be creative and to be ourselves with the reflection system. I already thought of a lot of ways to deliver my reflection for day one onwards, but I first decided to go with my developer's blog for the orientation day reflection. However, if given enough time I'm planning on creating an interactive game where my professors would have to solve a puzzle or complete a mini game in order to be able to read my reflection. Not only does this spice things up, but it also makes my reflection unique.

### It was a challenge

>Lastly, the videos they showed were really great, but after listening for some time it was clear that they were encouraging us and challenging us to make nationalistic choices for our future careers. Other than that, the biggest challenge of all is the fact that NSTP is a 8AM class.

### Closing

>With all that said, I have high hopes for NSTP. I hope I get to enjoy it by meeting new friends, speakers, and learning new things. I believe NSTP will allow me to interact with people who have other paradigms of thought. I look foward to everything.
